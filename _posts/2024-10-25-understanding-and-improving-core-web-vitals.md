Core Web Vitals (CWV) measure user experience aspects like loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability. Hereâ€™s how to optimize these metrics.

## Importance of Core Web Vitals

Improving CWV helps enhance user experience and is a Google ranking factor.

### 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

LCP measures loading performance. Aim for an LCP of under 2.5 seconds by optimizing images, code, and server response times.

### 2. First Input Delay (FID)

FID measures interactivity. Minimize JavaScript execution and leverage browser caching to reduce FID.

## Enhancing Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

CLS measures visual stability. Avoid sudden shifts by reserving space for images and ads.

## Wrapping Up

Optimizing Core Web Vitals can improve user experience and SEO performance. Use tools like **PageSpeed Insights** to monitor and enhance CWV.
